## Hi, I’m Hatice 👋

I’m a software developer focused on building strong and reliable foundations.

I approach development with clarity and intention.  
Instead of rushing through tools, I prioritize understanding structure, logic, and writing clean, readable code.

My development journey is actively ongoing, and I continue to grow through hands-on projects, consistent practice, and deeper exploration of core concepts.

### Current focus
- CS50x — building a strong foundation in computer science and problem solving  
- HTML & CSS fundamentals  
- Clean and structured code practices  
- Git & GitHub workflows  
- Progressing toward advanced topics (JavaScript and backend basics)

### Technologies
HTML5 • CSS3 • JavaScript (foundational) • Python (foundational) • SQL (foundational)

### Mindset
Strong foundations enable confident and sustainable growth.
